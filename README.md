# Smart Campus Power Management System

## 1. Project Title and Overview

The **Smart Campus Power Management System** is a Python OOP application that models the electricity monitoring infrastructure of a fictitious Nigerian university campus. Nigerian campuses face persistent challenges with erratic power supply, unmetered building consumption, and slow manual billing. This system addresses those challenges by tracking individual metered buildings (hostels, laboratories, lecture theatres, administrative blocks, and solar installations), computing electricity bills based on configurable peak and off-peak tariff schedules (06:00–22:00 peak; 22:00–06:00 off-peak), detecting consumption anomalies, raising priority-tiered fault alerts (CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO), and producing a campus-wide formatted power usage report. Every calculation traces back to an individual `PowerReading` snapshot, and every fault carries structured diagnostic information in a custom exception.

## 4. System Architecture

![UML Class Diagram](uml/class_diagram.png)

The system is structured around a clear ownership hierarchy. `CampusGrid` sits at the top and **owns** (composition) a list of `BuildingZone` objects and a list of `FaultAlert` objects — both are created inside the grid and have no meaningful existence outside it. Each `BuildingZone` **aggregates** (hollow diamond) multiple `MeterDevice` instances, meaning meters are created independently and passed in; they can be moved between zones without being destroyed.

`MeterDevice` is an abstract base class that **composes** `PowerReading` objects — every `take_reading()` call creates a new immutable `PowerReading` and stores it in the meter's private `_readings` list. The three concrete meter types (`SinglePhaseMeter`, `ThreePhaseMeter`, `SolarFeedMeter`) all **inherit** from `MeterDevice`, each implementing the required abstract methods with their own power formulae (P = V × I for single-phase; P = √3 × V × I × PF for three-phase; signed readings for solar).

`CampusGrid` **uses** (dependency) `TariffSchedule` to compute bills — it holds a reference to a tariff object but does not own its lifecycle. `OverloadError` is raised (dependency arrow) by `CampusGrid.check_overloads()` when a meter's current reading exceeds 150% of its rated capacity.

**Composition vs aggregation key decision:** `BuildingZone` aggregates meters rather than composing them because the same physical meter device (with its full reading history) might be reassigned to a different zone during campus restructuring. If we used composition, removing a zone would delete the meter's data. Aggregation preserves that independence.

## 7. Known Limitations

- **No real network communication:** The system models power readings using in-memory Python objects. Real SCADA/IoT integration (serial ports, MQTT, REST APIs) is out of scope.
- **Simulated timestamps only:** The `simulate_24h()` helper generates synthetic hourly timestamps starting from a fixed `datetime`. Real deployments would pull timestamps from hardware meters.
- **Fixed overload threshold:** The overload threshold is hardcoded at 10 A (single-phase) and 20 A (three-phase) as nominal design limits. A production system would read the rated capacity from meter configuration data.
- **No data persistence:** All meter readings and alerts are held in memory and lost when the program exits. A real system would write to a database.
- **Single-day simulation:** The demo only simulates one 24-hour period (15 hourly readings). Multi-day historical analysis is not implemented.
